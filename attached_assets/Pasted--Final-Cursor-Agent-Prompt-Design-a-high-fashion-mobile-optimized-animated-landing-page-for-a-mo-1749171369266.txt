 Final Cursor Agent Prompt:

Design a high-fashion, mobile-optimized, animated landing page for a modeling consultancy called LevelOneTalent, inspired by luxury agencies like Storm Models, Elite, and IMG.

🎯 Main Goal: Capture attention with an energetic and polished first impression, encouraging diverse users to sign up. Page must look alive, beautiful, and aspirational—yet advanced with motion and interaction.

🔹 Visual Style:
Use a vibrant, editorial palette: warm pastels, clean whites, soft beige, radiant pinks, peach, and golden skin tones. Accent with high-contrast fashion tones like neon coral, electric lavender, mint, or sky blue for subtle highlights.

The design must feel airy, elegant, and dynamic—like a Vogue editorial meets cutting-edge tech.

Use fashion photography-style imagery (can be mock placeholder) with soft gradients, parallax motion, and a luxury aesthetic.

✨ Hero Section:
Fullscreen, edge-to-edge editorial photo of a diverse model or group (set as full background with overlaying text and animation).

Add subtle WebGL animation over the background – like moving light streaks, subtle bloom particles, or glass morphing effects (use @react-three/fiber or lightweight canvas shaders).

Animated heading (Framer Motion):

H1: “MODELS WANTED” (Large, modern serif or editorial sans font)

Subhead: “All ages. All backgrounds. One chance to shine.”

Signup form (Name + Email + Submit) styled in white/peach glassmorphism with clean focus states

Button hover: gentle scale + gradient sweep animation

Add a subtle “We’ll guide you step by step” reassurance under the form

🔹 Modeling Categories Section:
Title: “Discover Your Lane” or “Categories We Cover”

Display four animated cards, each glowing softly or sliding into view on scroll, with imagery and modern fashion-style captions:

👧 Child & Teen – Fresh faces, big dreams

👨 Male – Editorial. Commercial. Iconic.

👩 Female – From beauty to catwalk.

👵 Mature – Style has no age.

Each card should:

Feature a vibrant model image

Use hover or tap animations (card zoom, slight tilt, text shift)

Rounded corners, soft shadow, and borderless glow

🔹 Footer:
Include social icons (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook) with soft hover animations

Add a clean link to privacy policy or FAQ

🌐 Responsive & Mobile-Ready:
Use Tailwind CSS responsive classes

On mobile: stack form + categories vertically with smooth scroll transitions

Keep text large and readable with comfortable padding

🛠 Tech & UX:
Built using React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion

Use @react-three/fiber for light WebGL effects or fallback canvas particles

Font suggestions:

Headlines: Playfair Display, Libre Bodoni, or Unbounded

Body: Poppins, Inter, or Urbanist

Use scroll-triggered animations, hover micro-interactions, and gradient transitions for a lively UX
